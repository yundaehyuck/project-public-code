That is, critics and \\nlaypeople alike could obtain new music simultaneously.

The data revealed that the \\nnews of the king’s death had been widely socially shared. By \\ntalking about the event, people gradually constructed a social \\nnarrative and a collective memory of the emotional event. At \\nthe same time, they consolidated their own memory of the \\npersonal circumstances in which the event took place, an \\neffect known as “flashbulb memory.” The more an event is \\nsocially shared, the more it will be fixed in people’s minds. \\nSocial sharing may in this way help to counteract some natural \\ntendency people may have. Naturally, people should be driven \\nto “forget” undesirable events. Thus, someone who just heard \\na piece of bad news often tends initially to deny what happened. \\nThe _ social sharing of the bad news contributes to \\nrealism.', 'Minorities tend not to have much power or status and may \\neven be dismissed as troublemakers, extremists or simply \\n‘weirdos’.

Such change has often occurred because a \\nminority has converted others to its point of view. Without the \\ninfluence of minorities, we would have no innovation, no \\nsocial change.

In this way, ‘thought\\nsuppression can actually increase the thoughts one wishes to\\nsuppress instead of calming them’. One common example of\\nthis is that people on a diet who try not to think about food\\noften begin to think much ① more about food. This process is\\ntherefore also known as the rebound effect. The ② ironic\\neffect seems to be caused by the interplay of two related\\ncognitive processes. This dual-process system involves, first,\\nan intentional operating process, which consciously attempts to\\nlocate thoughts ③ unrelated to the suppressed ones. Second,\\nand simultaneously, an unconscious monitoring process tests\\nwhether the operating system is functioning effectively. If the\\nmonitoring system encounters thoughts inconsistent with the\\nintended ones, it prompts the intentional operating process to\\nensure that these are replaced by ④ inappropriate thoughts.\\nHowever, it is argued, the intentional operating system can fail\\ndue to increased cognitive load caused by fatigue, stress and\\nemotional factors, and so the monitoring process filters the\\ninappropriate thoughts into consciousness, making them\\nhighly ⑤ accessible.', 'In a highly commercialized setting such as the United\\nStates, it is not surprising that many landscapes are seen as\\ncommodities.

I am planning a special workshop for our science \\nteachers. We are interested in learning how to teach online \\nscience classes. I have been impressed with your ideas about \\nusing internet platforms for science classes. Since you are an \\nexpert in online education, I would like to ask you to deliver \\na special lecture at the workshop scheduled for next month. \\nI am sure the lecture will help our teachers manage successful \\nonline science classes, and I hope we can learn from your \\ninsights. I am looking forward to hearing from you.\\nSincerely,\\nDonna Williams', 'One of the most common mistakes made by organizations \\nwhen they first consider experimenting with social media is \\nthat they focus too much on social media tools and platforms \\nand not enough on their business objectives. The reality of \\nsuccess in the social web for businesses is that creating a social \\nmedia program begins not with insight into the latest social \\nmedia tools and channels but with a thorough understanding of \\nthe organization’s own goals and objectives. A social media \\nprogram is not merely the fulfillment of a vague need to manage\\na “presence” on popular social networks because “everyone \\nelse is doing it.” “Being in social media” serves no purpose \\nin and of itself. In order to serve any purpose at all, a social \\nmedia presence must either solve a problem for the organization\\nand its customers or result in an improvement of some sort \\n(preferably a measurable one). In all things, purpose drives \\nsuccess. The world of social media is no different.', 'Environmental hazards include biological, physical, and \\nchemical ones, along with the human behaviors that promote \\nor allow exposure. Some environmental contaminants are \\ndifficult to avoid (the breathing of polluted air, the drinking of \\nchemically contaminated public drinking water, noise in open \\npublic spaces); in these circumstances, exposure is largely \\ninvoluntary. Reduction or elimination of these factors may require \\nsocietal action, such as public awareness and public health \\nmeasures. In many countries, the fact that some environmental \\nhazards are difficult to avoid at the individual level is felt to be \\nmore morally egregious than those hazards that can be avoided. \\nHaving no choice but to drink water contaminated with very \\nhigh levels of arsenic, or being forced to passively breathe in\\ntobacco smoke in restaurants, outrages people more than the \\npersonal choice of whether an individual smokes tobacco. \\nThese factors are important when one considers how change \\n(risk reduction) happens.', 'Scientists use paradigms rather than believing them. The use \\nof a paradigm in research typically addresses related problems \\nby employing shared concepts, symbolic expressions, \\nexperimental and mathematical tools and procedures, and even \\nsome of the same theoretical statements. Scientists need only \\nunderstand how to use these various elements in ways that \\nothers would accept. These elements of shared practice thus \\nneed not presuppose any comparable unity in scientists’ beliefs\\nabout what they are doing when they use them. Indeed, one role \\nof a paradigm is to enable scientists to work successfully \\nwithout having to provide a detailed account of what they are \\ndoing or what they believe about it. Thomas Kuhn noted that \\nscientists “can agree in their identification of a paradigm without \\nagreeing on, or even attempting to produce, a full interpretation\\nor rationalization of it. Lack of a standard interpretation or of \\nan agreed reduction to rules will not prevent a paradigm from \\nguiding research.”', 'Mending and restoring objects often require even more \\ncreativity than original production. The preindustrial blacksmith \\nmade things to order for people in his immediate community; \\ncustomizing the product, modifying or transforming it according\\nto the user, was routine. Customers would bring things back if \\nsomething went wrong; repair was thus an extension of \\nfabrication. With industrialization and eventually with mass \\nproduction, making things became the province of machine \\ntenders with limited knowledge. But repair continued to require\\na larger grasp of design and materials, an understanding of the\\nwhole and a comprehension of the designer’s intentions. \\n“Manufacturers all work by machinery or by vast subdivision \\nof labour and not, so to speak, by hand,” an 1896 Manual of \\nMending and Repairing explained. “But all repairing must be \\ndone by hand. We can make every detail of a watch or of a \\ngun by machinery, but the machine cannot mend it when \\nbroken, much less a clock or a pistol!”\\n', 'Donato Bramante, born in Fermignano, Italy, began to paint \\nearly in his life. His father encouraged him to study painting.\\nLater, he worked as an assistant of Piero della Francesca in \\nUrbino. Around 1480, he built several churches in a new style \\nin Milan. He had a close relationship with Leonardo da Vinci, \\nand they worked together in that city. Architecture became his \\nmain interest, but he did not give up painting. Bramante \\nmoved to Rome in 1499 and participated in Pope Julius II’s \\nplan for the renewal of Rome. He planned the new Basilica of \\nSt. Peter in Rome ― one of the most ambitious building projects \\nin the history of humankind. Bramante died on April 11, 1514 \\nand was buried in Rome. His buildings influenced other \\narchitects for centuries.', 'Classifying things together into groups is something we do \\nall the time, and it isn’t hard to see why. Imagine trying to \\nshop in a supermarket where the food was arranged in \\nrandom order on the shelves: tomato soup next to the white \\nbread in one aisle, chicken soup in the back next to the \\n60-watt light bulbs, one brand of cream cheese in front and \\nanother in aisle 8 near the cookies. The task of finding what \\nyou want would be time-consuming and extremely difficult, \\nif not impossible. \\nIn the case of a supermarket, someone had to design\\nthe system of classification. But there is also a ready-made \\nsystem of classification embodied in our language. The word \\n“dog,” for example, groups together a certain class of animals \\nand distinguishes them from other animals. Such a grouping \\nmay seem too abstract to be called a classification, but \\nthis is only because you have already mastered the word. As \\na child learning to speak, you had to work hard to learn\\nthe system of classification your parents were trying to teach \\nyou. Before you got the hang of it, you probably made \\nmistakes, like calling the cat a dog. If you hadn’t learned to \\nspeak, the whole world would seem like the unorganized\\nsupermarket; you would be in the position of an infant, for \\nwhom every object is new and unfamiliar. In learning the \\nprinciples of classification, therefore, we’ll be learning about \\nthe structure that lies at the core of our language.', 'Humour involves not just practical disengagement but \\ncognitive disengagement. As long as something is funny, we \\nare for the moment not concerned with whether it is real or \\nfictional, true or false. This is why we give considerable \\nleeway to people telling funny stories. If they are getting extra \\nlaughs by exaggerating the silliness of a situation or even by \\nmaking up a few details, we are happy to grant them comic \\nlicence, a kind of poetic licence. Indeed, someone listening to\\na funny story who tries to correct the teller ― ‘No, he didn’t \\nspill the spaghetti on the keyboard and the monitor, just on the \\nkeyboard’ ― will probably be told by the other listeners to \\nstop interrupting. The creator of humour is putting ideas into \\npeople’s heads for the pleasure those ideas will bring, not to \\nprovide _ information.', 'News, especially in its televised form, is constituted not \\nonly by its choice of topics and stories but by its _. Presentational \\nstyles have been subject to a tension between an \\ninformational-educational purpose and the need to engage us \\nentertainingly. While current affairs programmes are often \\n‘serious’ in tone sticking to the ‘rules’ of balance, more \\npopular programmes adopt a friendly, lighter, idiom in which \\nwe are invited to consider the impact of particular news items \\nfrom the perspective of the ‘average person in the street’. \\nIndeed, contemporary news construction has come to rely on an \\nincreased use of faster editing tempos and ‘flashier’ presentational \\nstyles including the use of logos, sound-bites, rapid visual cuts \\nand the ‘star quality’ of news readers. Popular formats can be \\nsaid to enhance understanding by engaging an audience unwilling\\nto endure the longer verbal orientation of older news formats. \\nHowever, they arguably work to reduce understanding by \\nfailing to provide the structural contexts for news events.', 'Elinor Ostrom found that there are several factors critical to \\nbringing about stable institutional solutions to the problem of\\nthe commons. She pointed out, for instance, that the actors \\naffected by the rules for the use and care of resources must \\nhave the right to _.\\nFor that reason, the people who monitor and control the \\nbehavior of users should also be users and/or have been given \\na mandate by all users. This is a significant insight, as it shows \\nthat prospects are poor for a centrally directed solution to the \\nproblem of the commons coming from a state power in \\ncomparison with a local solution for which users assume \\npersonal responsibility. Ostrom also emphasizes the importance \\nof democratic decision processes and that all users must be \\ngiven access to local forums for solving problems and conflicts\\namong themselves. Political institutions at central, regional, \\nand local levels must allow users to devise their own regulations \\nand independently ensure observance.', 'Precision and determinacy are a necessary requirement for \\nall meaningful scientific debate, and progress in the sciences \\nis, to a large extent, the ongoing process of achieving ever \\ngreater precision. But historical representation puts a premium\\non a proliferation of representations, hence not on the \\nrefinement of one representation but on the production of \\nan ever more varied set of representations. Historical insight \\nis not a matter of a continuous “narrowing down” of previous \\noptions, not of an approximation of the truth, but, on the \\ncontrary, is an “explosion” of possible points of view. It \\ntherefore aims at the unmasking of previous illusions of \\ndeterminacy and precision by the production of new and \\nalternative representations, rather than at achieving truth by \\na careful analysis of what was right and wrong in those \\nprevious representations. And from this perspective, the \\ndevelopment of historical insight may indeed be regarded by the\\noutsider as a process of creating ever more confusion, a continuous\\nquestioning of _ rather than, as in the sciences, an ever greater approximation \\nto the truth.', 'It was Evelyn’s first time to explore the Badlands of \\nAlberta, famous across Canada for its numerous dinosaur \\nfossils. As a young amateur bone-hunter, she was overflowing \\nwith anticipation. She had not travelled this far for the bones\\nof common dinosaur species. Her life-long dream to find rare \\nfossils of dinosaurs was about to come true. She began eagerly \\nsearching for them. After many hours of wandering throughout \\nthe deserted lands, however, she was unsuccessful. Now, the \\nsun was beginning to set, and her goal was still far beyond her\\nreach. Looking at the slowly darkening ground before her, she \\nsighed to herself, “I can’t believe I came all this way for \\nnothing.

I am planning a special workshop for our science \\nteachers. We are interested in learning how to teach online \\nscience classes. I have been impressed with your ideas about \\nusing internet platforms for science classes. Since you are an \\nexpert in online education, I would like to ask you to deliver \\na special lecture at the workshop scheduled for next month. \\nI am sure the lecture will help our teachers manage successful \\nonline science classes, and I hope we can learn from your \\ninsights. I am looking forward to hearing from you.\\nSincerely,\\nDonna Williams', 'One of the most common mistakes made by organizations \\nwhen they first consider experimenting with social media is \\nthat they focus too much on social media tools and platforms \\nand not enough on their business objectives. The reality of \\nsuccess in the social web for businesses is that creating a social \\nmedia program begins not with insight into the latest social \\nmedia tools and channels but with a thorough understanding of \\nthe organization’s own goals and objectives. A social media \\nprogram is not merely the fulfillment of a vague need to manage\\na “presence” on popular social networks because “everyone \\nelse is doing it.” “Being in social media” serves no purpose \\nin and of itself. In order to serve any purpose at all, a social \\nmedia presence must either solve a problem for the organization\\nand its customers or result in an improvement of some sort \\n(preferably a measurable one). In all things, purpose drives \\nsuccess. The world of social media is no different.', 'Environmental hazards include biological, physical, and \\nchemical ones, along with the human behaviors that promote \\nor allow exposure. Some environmental contaminants are \\ndifficult to avoid (the breathing of polluted air, the drinking of \\nchemically contaminated public drinking water, noise in open \\npublic spaces); in these circumstances, exposure is largely \\ninvoluntary. Reduction or elimination of these factors may require \\nsocietal action, such as public awareness and public health \\nmeasures. In many countries, the fact that some environmental \\nhazards are difficult to avoid at the individual level is felt to be \\nmore morally egregious than those hazards that can be avoided. \\nHaving no choice but to drink water contaminated with very \\nhigh levels of arsenic, or being forced to passively breathe in\\ntobacco smoke in restaurants, outrages people more than the \\npersonal choice of whether an individual smokes tobacco. \\nThese factors are important when one considers how change \\n(risk reduction) happens.', 'Scientists use paradigms rather than believing them. The use \\nof a paradigm in research typically addresses related problems \\nby employing shared concepts, symbolic expressions, \\nexperimental and mathematical tools and procedures, and even \\nsome of the same theoretical statements. Scientists need only \\nunderstand how to use these various elements in ways that \\nothers would accept. These elements of shared practice thus \\nneed not presuppose any comparable unity in scientists’ beliefs\\nabout what they are doing when they use them. Indeed, one role \\nof a paradigm is to enable scientists to work successfully \\nwithout having to provide a detailed account of what they are \\ndoing or what they believe about it. Thomas Kuhn noted that \\nscientists “can agree in their identification of a paradigm without \\nagreeing on, or even attempting to produce, a full interpretation\\nor rationalization of it. Lack of a standard interpretation or of \\nan agreed reduction to rules will not prevent a paradigm from \\nguiding research.”', 'Mending and restoring objects often require even more \\ncreativity than original production. The preindustrial blacksmith \\nmade things to order for people in his immediate community; \\ncustomizing the product, modifying or transforming it according\\nto the user, was routine. Customers would bring things back if \\nsomething went wrong; repair was thus an extension of \\nfabrication. With industrialization and eventually with mass \\nproduction, making things became the province of machine \\ntenders with limited knowledge. But repair continued to require\\na larger grasp of design and materials, an understanding of the\\nwhole and a comprehension of the designer’s intentions. \\n“Manufacturers all work by machinery or by vast subdivision \\nof labour and not, so to speak, by hand,” an 1896 Manual of \\nMending and Repairing explained. “But all repairing must be \\ndone by hand. We can make every detail of a watch or of a \\ngun by machinery, but the machine cannot mend it when \\nbroken, much less a clock or a pistol!”\\n', 'Donato Bramante, born in Fermignano, Italy, began to paint \\nearly in his life. His father encouraged him to study painting.\\nLater, he worked as an assistant of Piero della Francesca in \\nUrbino. Around 1480, he built several churches in a new style \\nin Milan. He had a close relationship with Leonardo da Vinci, \\nand they worked together in that city. Architecture became his \\nmain interest, but he did not give up painting. Bramante \\nmoved to Rome in 1499 and participated in Pope Julius II’s \\nplan for the renewal of Rome. He planned the new Basilica of \\nSt. Peter in Rome ― one of the most ambitious building projects \\nin the history of humankind. Bramante died on April 11, 1514 \\nand was buried in Rome. His buildings influenced other \\narchitects for centuries.', 'Classifying things together into groups is something we do \\nall the time, and it isn’t hard to see why. Imagine trying to \\nshop in a supermarket where the food was arranged in \\nrandom order on the shelves: tomato soup next to the white \\nbread in one aisle, chicken soup in the back next to the \\n60-watt light bulbs, one brand of cream cheese in front and \\nanother in aisle 8 near the cookies. The task of finding what \\nyou want would be time-consuming and extremely difficult, \\nif not impossible. \\nIn the case of a supermarket, someone had to design\\nthe system of classification. But there is also a ready-made \\nsystem of classification embodied in our language. The word \\n“dog,” for example, groups together a certain class of animals \\nand distinguishes them from other animals. Such a grouping \\nmay seem too abstract to be called a classification, but \\nthis is only because you have already mastered the word. As \\na child learning to speak, you had to work hard to learn\\nthe system of classification your parents were trying to teach \\nyou. Before you got the hang of it, you probably made \\nmistakes, like calling the cat a dog. If you hadn’t learned to \\nspeak, the whole world would seem like the unorganized\\nsupermarket; you would be in the position of an infant, for \\nwhom every object is new and unfamiliar. In learning the \\nprinciples of classification, therefore, we’ll be learning about \\nthe structure that lies at the core of our language.', 'Humour involves not just practical disengagement but \\ncognitive disengagement. As long as something is funny, we \\nare for the moment not concerned with whether it is real or \\nfictional, true or false. This is why we give considerable \\nleeway to people telling funny stories. If they are getting extra \\nlaughs by exaggerating the silliness of a situation or even by \\nmaking up a few details, we are happy to grant them comic \\nlicence, a kind of poetic licence. Indeed, someone listening to\\na funny story who tries to correct the teller ― ‘No, he didn’t \\nspill the spaghetti on the keyboard and the monitor, just on the \\nkeyboard’ ― will probably be told by the other listeners to \\nstop interrupting. The creator of humour is putting ideas into \\npeople’s heads for the pleasure those ideas will bring, not to \\nprovide _ information.', 'News, especially in its televised form, is constituted not \\nonly by its choice of topics and stories but by its _. Presentational \\nstyles have been subject to a tension between an \\ninformational-educational purpose and the need to engage us \\nentertainingly. While current affairs programmes are often \\n‘serious’ in tone sticking to the ‘rules’ of balance, more \\npopular programmes adopt a friendly, lighter, idiom in which \\nwe are invited to consider the impact of particular news items \\nfrom the perspective of the ‘average person in the street’. \\nIndeed, contemporary news construction has come to rely on an \\nincreased use of faster editing tempos and ‘flashier’ presentational \\nstyles including the use of logos, sound-bites, rapid visual cuts \\nand the ‘star quality’ of news readers. Popular formats can be \\nsaid to enhance understanding by engaging an audience unwilling\\nto endure the longer verbal orientation of older news formats. \\nHowever, they arguably work to reduce understanding by \\nfailing to provide the structural contexts for news events.', 'Elinor Ostrom found that there are several factors critical to \\nbringing about stable institutional solutions to the problem of\\nthe commons. She pointed out, for instance, that the actors \\naffected by the rules for the use and care of resources must \\nhave the right to _.\\nFor that reason, the people who monitor and control the \\nbehavior of users should also be users and/or have been given \\na mandate by all users. This is a significant insight, as it shows \\nthat prospects are poor for a centrally directed solution to the \\nproblem of the commons coming from a state power in \\ncomparison with a local solution for which users assume \\npersonal responsibility. Ostrom also emphasizes the importance \\nof democratic decision processes and that all users must be \\ngiven access to local forums for solving problems and conflicts\\namong themselves. Political institutions at central, regional, \\nand local levels must allow users to devise their own regulations \\nand independently ensure observance.', 'Precision and determinacy are a necessary requirement for \\nall meaningful scientific debate, and progress in the sciences \\nis, to a large extent, the ongoing process of achieving ever \\ngreater precision. But historical representation puts a premium\\non a proliferation of representations, hence not on the \\nrefinement of one representation but on the production of \\nan ever more varied set of representations. Historical insight \\nis not a matter of a continuous “narrowing down” of previous \\noptions, not of an approximation of the truth, but, on the \\ncontrary, is an “explosion” of possible points of view. It \\ntherefore aims at the unmasking of previous illusions of \\ndeterminacy and precision by the production of new and \\nalternative representations, rather than at achieving truth by \\na careful analysis of what was right and wrong in those \\nprevious representations. And from this perspective, the \\ndevelopment of historical insight may indeed be regarded by the\\noutsider as a process of creating ever more confusion, a continuous\\nquestioning of _ rather than, as in the sciences, an ever greater approximation \\nto the truth.', 'It was Evelyn’s first time to explore the Badlands of \\nAlberta, famous across Canada for its numerous dinosaur \\nfossils. As a young amateur bone-hunter, she was overflowing \\nwith anticipation. She had not travelled this far for the bones\\nof common dinosaur species. Her life-long dream to find rare \\nfossils of dinosaurs was about to come true. She began eagerly \\nsearching for them. After many hours of wandering throughout \\nthe deserted lands, however, she was unsuccessful. Now, the \\nsun was beginning to set, and her goal was still far beyond her\\nreach. Looking at the slowly darkening ground before her, she \\nsighed to herself, “I can’t believe I came all this way for \\nnothing. What a waste of time!”', 'Like whole individuals, cells have a life span. During their life \\ncycle (cell cycle), cell size, shape, and metabolic activities can \\nchange dramatically. A cell is “born” as a twin when its mother\\ncell divides, ① producing two daughter cells. Each daughter \\ncell is smaller than the mother cell, and except for unusual cases, \\neach grows until it becomes as large as the mother cell ② was. \\nDuring this time, the cell absorbs water, sugars, amino acids, \\nand other nutrients and assembles them into new, living \\nprotoplasm. After the cell has grown to the proper size, its \\nmetabolism shifts as it either prepares to divide or matures and\\n③ differentiates into a specialized cell. Both growth and \\ndevelopment require a complex and dynamic set of interactions \\ninvolving all cell parts. ④ What cell metabolism and structure \\nshould be complex would not be surprising, but actually, they \\nare rather simple and logical. Even the most complex cell has \\nonly a small number of parts, each ⑤ responsible for a distinct, \\nwell-defined aspect of cell life.', 'It has been suggested that “organic” methods, defined as \\nthose in which only natural products can be used as inputs, \\nwould be less damaging to the biosphere. Large-scale adoption \\nof “organic” farming methods, however, would ① reduce\\nyields and increase production costs for many major crops. \\nInorganic nitrogen supplies are ② essential for maintaining \\nmoderate to high levels of productivity for many of the \\nnon-leguminous crop species, because organic supplies of \\nnitrogenous materials often are either limited or more \\nexpensive than inorganic nitrogen fertilizers. In addition, there \\nare ③ benefits to the extensive use of either manure or legumes \\nas “green manure” crops. In many cases, weed control can be \\nvery difficult or require much hand labor if chemicals cannot \\nbe used, and ④ fewer people are willing to do this work as \\nsocieties become wealthier. Some methods used in “organic” \\nfarming, however, such as the sensible use of crop rotations \\nand specific combinations of cropping and livestock enterprises, \\ncan make important ⑤ contributions to the sustainability of \\nrural ecosystems.', 'Since their introduction, information systems have \\nsubstantially changed the way business is conducted. ① This is \\nparticularly true for business in the shape and form of \\ncooperation between firms that involves an integration of value\\nchains across multiple units. ② The resulting networks do not \\nonly cover the business units of a single firm but typically also \\ninclude multiple units from different firms. ③ As a consequence, \\nfirms do not only need to consider their internal organization \\nin order to ensure sustainable business performance; they also \\nneed to take into account the entire ecosystem of units \\nsurrounding them. ④ Many major companies are fundamentally \\nchanging their business models by focusing on profitable units \\nand cutting off less profitable ones. ⑤ In order to allow these \\ndifferent units to cooperate successfully, the existence of a \\ncommon platform is crucial.', 'Introduction of robots into factories, while employment of human \\nworkers is being reduced, creates worry and fear. ( ① ) It is \\nthe responsibility of management to prevent or, at least, to ease \\nthese fears. ( ② ) For example, robots could be introduced only \\nin new plants rather than replacing humans in existing assembly\\nlines.
